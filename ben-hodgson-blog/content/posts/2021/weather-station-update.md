Well I ran the sensors for a week at hand hour intervals and got a quite a few readings. Iâ€™m thinking of having play around with numpy or pandas and graphing the daily averages of the readings.

I had a few outliers with some of the humidity readings where it would jump to around 140%, but I think that was down to the wiring in the breadboard not the sensor as there were a few times where there was no readings from the DHT11 too.
