## Raspberry Pi 0W Stack

Over the last few years I have gathered a few Raspberry Pi 0Ws. These had been spaced over my desk either gathering dust while I found something to do with them or they had little things running on them such as my DHT11 and BMP280 for temperature and humidity.

I designed a quick plate to attach the Raspberry Pi 0s to using m2.5 screws.
